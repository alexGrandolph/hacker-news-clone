# hacker-news-clone
This application makes use of the HackerNews API to create a 'clone' of the HackerNews [site](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
My learning goals for this application were to call an API and digest & display the data, as well as dive into State and State Management within a vanilla JavaScript applicaation.
<br>
This app was my first time calling an API with vanilla JavaScript.  The built in `fetch()` function along with `await` and `async` keywords made calling the API a breeze and seamless. The application calls 5 seperate endpoints to offer users a variety of stories as well as view comments and nested comments on individual stories. 
This app also allows users to Favorite and Un-Favorite stories, adding or removing the stories to the applications State.

This application was deployed to Vercel and can be found [HERE](https://hacker-news-clone-rosy.vercel.app/)!
